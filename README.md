The Frameworkless Movement is a group of developers interested in developing applications without frameworks. We don't hate frameworks, nor we will ever create campaigns against frameworks, but we perceive the **misuse of frameworks as a lack of knowledge regarding technical debt** and the availability of alternatives given by the vanilla language or by dedicated libraries.

## Why the Movement

Every time a team uses a framework, it also takes a **risk**. The risk is that after some time has passed the team ends up with a tool that does not provide any kind of value anymore and that most of the times represents a major roadblock to change. Most importantly a framework could "die" way before the software that uses it, leaving the developers with a heavy burden.

This risk is amplified without the presence of a strong bond between technical decision making and business goals. We think that every technical decision, including the choice of a framework, should be made considering every aspect of the context the software "lives".

## Our purpose
We commit to learn and help others learn how to deliver software with a Frameworkless approach. This means to **consider a "No Framework" as an option when choosing a technology** for a new project or a new feature of an existing project. We also want to help everybody make mindful tech decisions.

Like we stated before, **we don't think that frameworks are evil**. They are the most powerful tools to learn how to code without them. This is because in order to know how and when you should use one particular framework you have to understand how frameworks work. Having clear opportunities and constraints of each framework it will be easier to make the right choice, also it will be clear when you don't need one. Furthermore, understanding how frameworks work behind the scenes will deepen your awareness about the language. Every framework is written in plain vanilla language and it is very generic. Knowing the frameworks rationale you will able to write better specific code.

Nevertheless, we think that frameworks should be used responsibly. Remembering that every tool has some kind of tradeoff.

## What Frameworkless Movement is not

Frameworkless **does not mean that we have to (or we want to) build our own framework**. It means taking a conscious decision about if we want to get help to do our own job from tools already in existence and in what way.

Frameworkless **does not mean "reinvent the wheel"**. There are a lot of "tools" (frameworks, libraries but also StackOverflow) that solve known and common problems in a great way. Frameworkless means, however, not to assume that in the software I'm writing I can afford to delegate this responsibility and depend on other software (a library for example) to solve a specific problem. Or worse: don't reinvent the wheel and bind hand and foot to a whole framework even if I don't really need it.

Frameworkless **does not mean that you must develop all software by yourself without a framework** in every context and in every situation, thinking that this is more secure and more high-performance ([Not Invented Here syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here#In_computing)), far from it.

Frameworkless means give the right importance to the technological decision making and keep in mind during the technological choice that the chance to develop a project or a single feature with no dependence on a framework is a real possibility.

But Frameworkless also means that you must take into account the entire context where the software will have to "be born" and "live". Including the developers' skills who have to develop the software, deciding to get help from a framework keeping in mind the reasons that support this choice and the tradeoffs.

## Principles

These are a draft of the principles that guide us:

* Our primary objective is to deliver quality software in reasonable time. If we can achieve this without frameworks, we prefer not to use them.
* We commit to study and understand the code of the framework we use.
* We also take into consideration non-functional requirements, in order to choose a good framework.
* We make explicit both reasons and tradeoffs behind every technical decision.

## Our Manifesto

We are going to define and publish the Manifesto of the Movement. **We want to create it sharing our ideas with other developers, so right now we're creating a distributed team to help us to create a good Manifesto**. If you want to be part of this team please send an email to info@frameworklessmovement.org.

## Be Involved

**We accept any kind of feedback**, so if you want to discuss with us about any of the topics stated here just open an Issue or a Pull Request.

Since we don't have a manifesto yet, there's no way to actually sign it for now. **To show appreciation for this idea you can star the repo**, it will help us to understand how many people are interested in this topic.
