The Frameworkless Movement is a group of developers interested in developing applications without frameworks. We don't hate frameworks, nor we will ever create campaigns against frameworks, but we perceive the **misuse of frameworks as a lack of knowledge regarding technical debt** and the availability of alternatives given by the languages or by dedicated libraries.

We believe that a framework, when chosen, should be used **responsibly** throughout the life of the project. Continuously remind yourself that **every tool has some kind of tradeoff**.

We also want to give the right importance to **technical decision-making** and in realizing that the choice to develop a project or a single feature with no dependence on a framework is a **real possibility**.

**With this movement we want to create awareness around these topics, gathering together people in a community.**

## Principles

Everytime that we need to choose a framework for a project we will use these principles to guide our choices.

* **The value of a software is not the code itself but in the reasons behind the existence of that code.**

* **Every decision should be made considering the context, not simply the list of requirements.**

* **Every project and every team are unique, with their properties and needs. A good choice for a context could be a bad choice for another one.**

* **The choice of a framework is a technical choice and thus should be made by technical people, but to make mindful decisions business needs should be kept in consideration.**

* **The decision-making criteria that made someone to choose a framework should be accessible to all the members in the team.**
